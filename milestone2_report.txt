FEATURE ENGINEERING SUMMARY:
----------------------------
Input Dataset             : azure_demand_cleaned.csv
Output Dataset            : azure_demand_feature_engineered.csv
Original Features         : 16
New Features Created      : 9
Total Features            : 25

DATA TRANSFORMATION:
-------------------
Starting Records          : 5,200
Records Dropped (NaN)     : 240
Final Records             : 4,960
Data Retention Rate       : 95.4%

Date Range (Original)     : April 1, 2023 to March 31, 2025
Date Range (Final)        : May 1, 2023 to March 31, 2025
Note: First 30 days dropped per region-service due to lag features

FEATURE CATEGORIES:
------------------
1. Time Features (1)
   - week_of_year: ISO calendar week number (1-52)

2. Lag Features (3)
   - lag_1: Usage from 1 day ago
   - lag_7: Usage from 7 days ago (week-over-week comparison)
   - lag_30: Usage from 30 days ago (month-over-month comparison)

3. Rolling Statistics (2)
   - rolling_mean_7: 7-day moving average (trend indicator)
   - rolling_std_7: 7-day volatility (demand stability measure)

4. Capacity Metrics (3)
   - capacity_utilization: Actual usage / Provisioned capacity ratio
   - over_provisioned_flag: 1 if utilization < 75%, 0 otherwise
   - high_stress_flag: 1 if utilization > 90%, 0 otherwise

DATA QUALITY:
------------
Missing Values (Before dropna)  : 392 (in lag and rolling features)
Missing Values (After dropna)   : 0
Data Completeness                : 100%

KEY STATISTICS (Final Dataset):
-------------------------------
Total Records                    : 4,960
Regions Covered                  : 4 (US-East, US-West, Europe-North, India-South)
Service Types                    : 2 (Compute, Storage)
Records per Region-Service       : ~620 each

FEATURE ENGINEERING BENEFITS:
-----------------------------
✓ Historical patterns captured through lag features
✓ Trend analysis enabled via rolling statistics
✓ Capacity planning insights through utilization metrics
✓ Anomaly detection support via volatility measures
✓ Ready for time-series forecasting models

TECHNICAL NOTES:
---------------
- Lag and rolling features calculated per region-service group
- NaN values from lag/rolling operations handled by dropping initial periods
- All features properly sorted by timestamp for time-series integrity
- Capacity utilization normalized to 0-1 scale for modeling

NEXT STEPS (MILESTONE 3):
-------------------------
1. Split data into train/validation/test sets (time-based split)
2. Train baseline models (ARIMA, Naive forecasting)
3. Train ML models (XGBoost, Random Forest, LightGBM)
4. Evaluate model performance (MAE, RMSE, MAPE)
5. Select best model for production deployment

POTENTIAL MODEL INPUTS:
----------------------
Target Variable           : usage_units
Feature Count             : 24 (excluding target)
Categorical Features      : region, service_type
Numerical Features        : 22
Time-based Features       : 7 (year, month, quarter, day_of_week, is_weekend, week_of_year)
Lag Features             : 3
Rolling Features         : 2
Capacity Features        : 3
Other Features           : 7
